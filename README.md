bltools: Unix style tools for biological sequences
======================================================

blgrep: Grep for biological sequences
--------------------------------------

blgrep is a C++ program based on the Seqan library that performs regex
searches on biological sequences. It is meant to act very much like
grep, except that it works on sequence records instead of lines in a
file.

blhead
----------

Very much like head, but for sequences.
