bltools: Unix style tools for biological sequences
======================================================

blgrep: Grep for biological sequences
--------------------------------------

blgrep is a C++ program based on the Seqan library that performs regex
searches on biological sequences. It is meant to act very much like
grep, except that it works on sequence records instead of lines in a
file.

blhead and bltail
-------------------

Very much like head and tail, but for sequences. Note that there has to
be a space between `-n' and the value, unlike the real tail and head
commands.
